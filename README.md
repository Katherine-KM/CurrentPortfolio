My learning was focused on making a simple project with React that would show my skills and other projects. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I will start by doing a redesign since it could be more clean and more professional. I want to also add a light/dark mode version with other effects depending on what season the viewer wants to see. Rain for Spring, Snow for Winter, Fireflies for Summer, and Leaves for Fall. 

## Lessons Learned:
While using React for a one-page project that does not dynamically update may have been overkill. It didn't require any advanced features and didn't make use of any of the performance benefits that comes from using React. However, I am glad that I had used this as an opportunity to work with React and to learn about its code structure and declarative programming model. One thing I gained from creating this project as one of my first steps into learning React, is the importance of separating your components and pages in a clear and organized manner to improve efficiency and mantainability of code.
